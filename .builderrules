1.	When a server restart is needed, you restart it. Don’t ask me to do it.
2.	Do not add CASCADE ON DELETE constraints on tables unless I tell you to.
3.	Always use thematic colors, not whatever color you want. For example, if I tell you to make something blue, make it one of the thematic blue colors, not some random rgb color you chose.
4. All links should be anchors to enable opening the link in a new table by (1) using the middle mouse button, (2) Ctrl + clicking, (3) right clicking and opening the context menu that has the "Open in new tab" button, and, (4) on mobile, holding down the link and having the context menu open there.
5. Screenshots don't work from your end; you will always be met with a welcome splash, so don't even bother.
