1.	When a server restart is needed, you restart it. Don’t ask me to do it.
2.	Do not add CASCADE ON DELETE constraints on tables unless I tell you to.
3.	Always use thematic colors, not whatever color you want. For example, if I tell you to make something blue, make it one of the thematic blue colors, not some random rgb color you chose.
4. All links should be able to be opened in a new tab by (1) using the middle mouse button, (2) Ctrl + clicking, (3) right clicking and opening the context menu that has the "Open in new tab" button, and, (4) on mobile, holding down the link and having the context menu open there.
