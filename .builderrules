1.	When a server restart is needed, you restart it. Don’t ask me to do it.
2.	Do not add CASCADE ON DELETE constraints on tables unless I tell you to.
3.	Always use thematic colors, not whatever color you want. For example, if I tell you to make something blue, make it one of the thematic blue colors, not some random rgb color you chose.
